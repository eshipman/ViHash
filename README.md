# ViHash
This is a semi-custom hash visualization algorithm similar to ssh-keygen's algorithm. As I implement it in other languages, I will update the source files in this repo.

## Current Implementations:
 - Python 3
 - C

## Planned Implementations:
 - Java

## Example Output:
The following is the output using SHA-256 and 'Hello, World!' as the input:
```
+---ViHash 1.0---+
|   .  .         |
|    .III        |
|    .RI         |
|   .I  .I0.     |
|    .I0II       |
|    0R I I.     |
|  .RI .I        |
|     I +        |
+----------------+
```
